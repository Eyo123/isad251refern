# PRCO204 Coursework - Flight Application - Group X

## Product vision
As a team, we have designed an airline booking system. The system consists of a desktop and mobile compatible website which is connected to a single web API, connected to a MySQL database. 

At its core, the system allows customers to book flights to selected countries. They can do this by searching for specific flights or checking currently available flights. Additionally, customers can view their previously and currently booked flights, pay for booked flights, cancel booked flights, and send secure messages to an employee. 

Furthermore, customers can create an account and then view and edit their own account details. They can also delete their account from the database. 

Administrators can create, update, and delete flights, journeys, and airports. Moreover, they can view ongoing flight statistics and an audit log showing all database interactions.
